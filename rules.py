way that improves their ability to score during a Match.
A Team can submit their code for Autonomous operation as well as their code for the Driver Controlled operation, if they choose.
The Judges are responsible for collecting the content sheet at the beginning of the Teams’ Interview.
After the Team Interview is complete, the Judges will reference the sections of the Engineering Notebook the Team has
pointed out on the Control Award Content Sheet.
The Judges should pay attention to look for:
- What sensors and hardware the Team has tried on the Robot;  what worked, what didn’t, and why.
- Teams are not required to include a printed copy of their Robot code in the Control Award application or in the Engineering Notebook.
- What algorithm or code the Team has programmed  with; what worked, what didn’t, and why.
- The Judges should pay attention to the program and design process. The design process is more critical than the code itself.
- Just like having Engineering Notebook reviewers, the Judge Advisor will assign a group of 2-3 Judges to review the Control Award Content Sheets, once Interviews are complete.

Maximum Starting Size - The maximum size of the Robot for starting a match is 18 inches (45.72 cm) wide by 18 inches (45.72 cm) long by 18 inches (45.72 cm) high.
The Robot Sizing Box will be used as the official gauge to make sure Robots comply with this Rule.
To pass inspection a Robot must fit within the box while in its match start configuration and orientation without exerting force on the sides or top of the box.
Robots may expand beyond the starting size constraint after the start of the match.
The Alliance flag and preloaded game elements may extend outside the starting volume constraint.
The Robot must be self-supporting while in the Robot Sizing Box by either:
	a. A mechanical means with the Robot in a power-OFF condition. Any restraints used to maintain starting size (that is, zip ties, rubber bands, string, etc.) MUST remain attached to the Robot for the entire match.
	b. A Robot Initialization Routine in the Autonomous operational mode (op mode) program that may preposition the servo motors, with the Robot in a power-ON condition, to the desired stationary position. If the Robot Initialization Routine does move the servos when a program is executed, there must be an indicator on the Robot of this fact. A warning label placed near the Robot’s main power switch is required. Attach the image (“WARNING! - Robot moves on Initialization”) to your Robot near the Robot main power switch if servos are commanded to move during the initialization routine. To be easily seen by field personnel the label should be at least 1 in x 2.63 in (2.54 cm x 6.68 cm, Avery Label # 5160) and placed on a flat surface (not wrapped around corners or cylinders).

Yellow Cards and Red Cards are used in the FIRST Tech Challenge to manage Team and Robot behavior that does not align with the mission of FIRST. 
Yellow and Red Cards are not limited to just the Competition Area. 
Teams that display egregious behavior in the Pit Area, Judging Rooms, stands, or any other location of the Event can be issued a Yellow or Red Card for egregious behavior. Egregious or repeated (3 or more) Robot or Team member behavior at the Event can result in a Yellow and/or Red Card. The Head Referee may assign a Yellow Card as a warning, or a Red Card for Disqualification in a match. A Yellow Card or Red Card is signaled by the Head Referee standing in front of the Team’s Alliance Station and holding a Yellow Card and/or Red Card in the air. Yellow Cards are additive, meaning that a second Yellow Card is automatically converted to a Red Card. A Team is issued a Red Card for any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional Yellow Card, including earning a second Yellow Card during a single match. To issue the second yellow card, the Head Referee will stand in front of the Team’s Alliance Station and hold a Yellow Card and Red Card. The Head Referee will signal the second Yellow Card after the match has ended. A Team that has received either a Yellow Card or a Red Card carries a Yellow Card into following matches, except as noted below. A Red Card results in match Disqualification. Multiple Red Cards may lead to Tournament Disqualification. Once a Team receives a Yellow Card or Red Card, the Team number is presented with a yellow background on the audience screen at the beginning of all following matches. This is a reminder to the Team, referees, and audience the Team carries a Yellow Card. Yellow Cards do not carry over from the Qualification Matches to the Elimination Matches. During the Elimination Matches, Yellow and Red Cards count against the entire Alliance, not to a specific Team. If a Team receives a Yellow Card or Red Card, it results in the entire Alliance receiving the Yellow Card or Red Card for that match. If two different Teams on the same Alliance are issued Yellow Cards, the entire Alliance is issued a Red Card. A Red Card results in zero (0) points for that match, and the Alliance loses the match. If both Alliances receive Red Cards, the Alliance which committed the action earning the Red Card first chronologically loses the match.
